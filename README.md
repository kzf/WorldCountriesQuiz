# World Countries Quiz
A mobile webapp capable quiz app testing knowledge of countries. Keeps track of your record for each country using HTML5 localstorage and lets you 'Swot Up' on the countries you have been struggling with. Uses the fantastic [jQuery Autocomplete](https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete) to suggest country names. Uses d3.js for globe visualisation and lettering.js for text animations.
